- Request body must be in JSON format

###Parameters (naming, etc.)
- Parameter name must be in present simple tense word and in lower_snake_case
- Nested parameters refer to Collections section below
- Parameter name must not be abbreviated except the common one such as `id` or `cif`
- Prefer non-numeric parameter over numeric parameters. For example: `primary_address`, `secondary_address` over `address_1`, `address_2`
- Prefer not to repeat the resource name in the parameter name unless help the ambiguousness

Example

###Metadata
- Metadata is optional, depends on the resource requirements
- Metadata must be treat as supporting information where resource provider not use directly. For example: To deposit by stall, stall ID is metadata to deposit resource provider
- Metadata must be key-value pairs and supports only string-to-string mapping
- Metadata keys must be lower_snake_case

Example

###Collections
- Object (where all keys is required) must be named in singular, present simple tense word
- List-like object (such as arrays) must be in plural, present simple tense word
- Dictionary-like object (where keys are used for mapping such as maps) must be in plural or name that indicated mapping

Example

```json
// Object
{
  “credential”: {
    “username”: “user”,
    “password”: “$3cr3t”
  }
}
 
// List
{
  “accounts”: [
    {
      ...
    }, {
      ...
    }, {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
 
// Dictionary
{
  “errors”: {
    “E000000”: “Unexpected error occurred”,
    “E000001”: “...”,
    ...
  }
}
 
{
  “error_table”: {
    “E000000”: “Unexpected error occurred”,
    “E000001”: “...”,
    ...
  }
}
```

###Pagination
To support pagination (returning list results in pages) in a List method, the API shall:

- define a string field page_token in the List method's request message. The client uses this field to request a specific page of the list results.
- define an int32 field page_size in the List method's request message. Clients use this field to specify the maximum number of results to be returned by the server. The server may further constrain the maximum number of results returned in a single page. - If the page_size is 0, the server will decide the number of results to be returned.
- define a string field next_page_token in the List method's response message. This field represents the pagination token to retrieve the next page of results. If the value is "", it means no further results for the request.

To retrieve the next page of results, client shall pass the value of response's next_page_token in the subsequent List method call (in the request message's page_token field):

```
listBooks(ListBooksRequest) returns (ListBooksResponse);

message ListBooksRequest {
  string name = 1;
  int32 page_size = 2;
  string page_token = 3;
}

message ListBooksResponse {
  repeated Book books = 1;
  string next_page_token = 2;
}
```

When clients pass in query parameters in addition to a page token, the service must fail the request if the query parameters are not consistent with the page token.

Page token contents should be a web-safe base64 encoded protocol buffer. This allows the contents to evolve without compatibility issues. If the page token contains potentially sensitive information, that information should be encrypted. Services must prevent tampering with page tokens from exposing unintended data through one of the following methods:

- require query parameters to be respecifed on follow up requests.
- only reference server-side session state in the page token.
- encrypt and sign the query parameters in the page token and revalidate and reauthorize these parameters on every call.

An implementation of pagination may also provide the total count of items in an int32 field named total_size.

##Represent Ranges
Fields that represent ranges should use half-open intervals with naming convention [start_xxx, end_xxx), such as [start_key, end_key) or [start_time, end_time). Half-open interval semantics is commonly used by C++ STL library and Java standard library. APIs should avoid using other ways of representing ranges, such as (index, count), or [first, last].

##Sorting Ordering

###Network Optimization
- Prefer to send request/response parameters as few as possible to reduce the network usage
- Excess parameters must not be sent
- Empty or undefined values (including `null`) must not be sent
