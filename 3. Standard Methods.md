## Mapping Standard Methods to HTTP Methods

The following table describes how to map standard methods to HTTP methods:
(If there is any other method name, please add to this table with example)

|Standard Method |	HTTP Mapping |	HTTP Request Body	| HTTP Response Body
|------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|
|List	|GET <collection URL>|	Empty	| Resource*list|
|Get	|GET <resource URL>	|Empty|	Resource*
|Create	|POST <collection URL>|	Resource|	Resource*|
|Update	|PUT or PATCH <resource URL>	|Resource|	Resource*|
|Delete	|DELETE <resource URL>	|Empty|	Empty**|

### List
The List method takes a collection name and zero or more parameters as input, and returns a list of resources that match the input.

HTTP mapping:
- The List method must use an HTTP GET verb.
- All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters.
- There is no request body; the API configuration must not declare a body clause.
- The response body should contain a list of resources along with optional metadata.
- Listable collections should support pagination

Example


```javascript

```

### Get
The Get method takes a resource name, zero or more parameters, and returns the specified resource.

HTTP mapping:

- The Get method must use an HTTP GET verb.
- The request message field(s) receiving the resource name should map to the URL path.
- All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters.
- There is no request body; the API configuration must not declare a body clause.
- The returned resource shall map to the entire response body.

Example

```javascript

```

### Create
The Create method takes a collection name, a resource, and zero or more parameters. It creates a new resource in the specified collection, and returns the newly created resource.
If the API supports creating resources, it should have a Create method for each type of resource that can be created.

HTTP mapping:

- The Create method must use an HTTP POST verb.
- The request may contain a field named <resource>_id to allow callers to select a client assigned id. This field must map to the URL query parameters.
- The returned resource shall map to the entire response body.

Example

```javascript

```

### Update
The Update method takes a request message containing a resource and zero or more parameters. It updates the specified resource and its properties, and returns the updated resource

Any functionality to rename or move a resource must not happen in the Update method and instead shall be handled by a custom method.

HTTP mapping:
- Use an HTTP PUT verb should support partial resource update and use HTTP verb PATCH with a FieldMask field named update_mask.
- If the Update method only supports full resource update, it must use HTTP verb PUT
- The message field receiving the resource name must map to the URL path. The field may be in the resource message itself.
- The request message field containing the resource must map to the request body.
- All remaining request message fields must map to the URL query parameters.
- The response message must be the updated resource itself.
- the Update method should fail with non-existent resource name. The error code NOT_FOUND should be used if it is the only error condition.


Example

```javascript

```

### Delete
The Delete method takes a resource name and zero or more parameters, and deletes or schedules for deletion the specified resource.

HTTP mapping:
- The Delete method must use an HTTP DELETE verb.
- The request message field(s) receiving the resource name should map to the URL path.
- All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters.
- There is no request body; the API configuration must not declare a body clause.
- If the Delete method immediately removes the resource, it should return an empty response.
- If the Delete method initiates a long-running operation, it should return the long-running operation.
- If the Delete method only marks the resource as being deleted, it should return the updated resource.


Example

```javascript

```
