##URL Structures

###Internal URLs
URL should be in the following format… where
- {host} - host to the service
- {service} - service name
- {operation} - service operation
 
```
https://{host}/{service}/{operation}
```
###External URLs
 
URL should be in the following format… where
- {host} – host to the service
- {version} - API version
- {resource} - an object for the interaction
- {operation} - operation to applied on the resource
 
```
https://{host}/{product}/{version}/{resource}/{operation}
```

### URL length

URL must no longer than 1024 characters.

## Resource Names

The resource name is organized hierarchically using collection IDs and resource IDs, separated by forward slashes. If a resource contains a sub-resource, the sub-resource's name is formed by specifying the parent resource name followed by the sub-resource's ID - again, separated by forward slashes.

Resource Name must be in following this format

Ex. Inquire customer's account detail

| API Service Name  | Collection ID           | Resource ID  | Collection ID | Resource ID
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| //mail   | customers | :customerID | accounts | :accountID |


Full REST Resource Name

```

## HTTP Methods

|GET|Return the current value of an object|
|PUT|Replace an object, or create a named object, when applicable|
|DELETE|Delete an object|
|POST|Create a new object based on the data provided, or submit a command|
|HEAD|Return metadata of an object for a GET response. Resources that support the GET method MAY support the HEAD method as well|
|PATCH|Apply a partial update to an object|


##Query
- Each query must be treat as a special field name and must be in present simple tense and lower_snake_case (typical queries) or camelCase (special queries)

```
 
Nested filters must surrounded with [] (bracket)
 
```

```



##Resource Access
- When “GET” resources from the service, the resource name must be plural, present simple tense word

Example
```
GET /v1/stalls
```
- When request a specific resource, the resource ID must be part of an URL structure
- When resource is nested of another resource, the resource ID must also be part of that particular URL structure

Example
```

GET /v1/stall/1/account/2
```

When create or delete a resource, the resource name must be singular, present simple tense word

Example
```
