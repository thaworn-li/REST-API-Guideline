##Custom Methods
- Custom methods refer to API methods besides the 5 standard methods.
- They should only be used for functionality that cannot be easily expressed via standard methods.

###HTTP mapping

```javascript
https://service.name/v1/some/resource/name:customVerb
```

- Custom methods should use HTTP POST
- Custom methods using HTTP GET must be idempotent and have no side effects.
- The request message field(s) receiving the resource name of the resource or collection with which the custom method is associated should map to the URL path.
- The URL path must end with a suffix consisting of a colon followed by the custom verb.

Example

```
POST /deposit:validate-transaction 
```

```javascript
validateTransaction (ValidateTransactionRequest request) {
  ...
    let validateTransactionResponse = { /* Data */ };
    response.send({
        status: 200,
        body: validateTransactionResponse
    });
}
```

###Use cases
- Move message
- Batch methods : For performance critical methods, it may be useful to provide custom batch methods to reduce per-request overhead.
