This section describes a set of standard message field definitions that should be used when similar concepts are needed. (Please add new field to this table)

| Name |	Type | Description
|------------- |-------------|------|
|create_timestamp| |The creation timestamp of an entity.|
|update_timestamp| |The last update timestamp of an entity. Note: update_time is updated when create/patch/delete operation is performed.|
|delete_timestamp| |The deletion timestamp of an entity, only if it supports retention.|
|page_size| ||
|page_token| ||
|next_page_token| ||

#JSON Standardizations
- Primitive values must be serialized to JSON following the rules of RFC-4627

##Dates and Times
- Parameter indicated both date and time must use the word `timestamp` instead
- Dates and times values, durations, intervals and repeating intervals must be serialized to string following the rules of ISO-8601

##Durations
Durations need to be serialized in conformance with ISO 8601. Durations are "represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S." From the standard:
- P is the duration designator (historically called "period") placed at the start of the duration representation.
- Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.
- M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.
- W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
- D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.
- T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
- H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
- M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
- S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds."

##Intervals
Intervals are defined as part of ISO 8601.
- Start and end, such as "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
- Start and duration, such as "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M"
- Duration and end, such as "P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
- Duration only, such as "P1Y2M10DT2H30M," with additional context information

##Repeating intervals
Repeating Intervals, as per ISO 8601, are:

Formed by adding "R[n]/" to the beginning of an interval expression, where R is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] means an unbounded number of repetitions.

Example
```
{
  “create_timestamp”: “2017-02-07T16:36Z”
}
 
{
  “duration”: “P1Y2M3DT1H2M3S”
}
 
{
  “interval”: “2017-02-07T16:36Z/P1Y2M3DT1H2M3S”
}
 
{
  “repeating_interval”: “R5/2017-02-07T16:36Z/P1Y2M3DT1H2M3S”
}
```
